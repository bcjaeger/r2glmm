# r2glmm

This package computes model and semi partial $R^2$ with confidence limits for the linear and generalized linear mixed model (LMM and GLMM). The $R^2$ measure from @edwards2008r2 is extended to the GLMM using penalized quasi-likelihood (PQL) estimation (see @r2glmmJaeger).

* Why use this package?

The $R^2$ statistic is a well known tool that describes goodness-of-fit for a statistical model. In the linear model, $R^2$ is interpreted as the proportion of variance in the data explained by the fixed predictors and semi-partial $R^2$ provide standardized measures of effect size for subsets of fixed predictors. In the linear mixed model, numerous definitions of $R^2$ exist and interpretations vary by definition. The r2glmm package computes $R^2$ using three definitions:

1. $R_\beta^2$, a standardized measure of multivariate association between the fixed predictors and the observed outcome. This method was introduced by @edwards2008r2.
2. $R_\Sigma^2$, the proportion of generalized variance explained by the fixed predictors. This method was introduced by @r2glmmJaeger
3. $R_{(m)}^2$, the proportion of variance explained by the fixed predictors. This method was introduced by @nakagawa2013general and later modified by @johnson2014extension.

Each interpretation can be used for model selection and is helpful for summarizing model goodness-of-fit. While the information criteria are useful tools for model selection, they do not quantify goodness-of-fit, making the $R^2$ statistic an excellent tool to accompany values of AIC and BIC. Additionally, in the context of mixed models, semi-partial $R^2$ and confidence limits are two useful and exclusive features of the r2glmm package.

* Instructions for installation:

The most up-to-date version of the r2glmm package is available on Github. To download the package from Github, after installing and loading the devtools package, run the following code from the R console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github('bcjaeger/r2glmm')
```

Alternatively, There is a version of the package available on CRAN. To download the package from CRAN, run the following code from the R console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('r2glmm')
```

* How to use this package

The main function in this package is called r2beta. The r2beta function summarizes a mixed model by computing the model $R^2$ statistic and semi-partial $R^2$ statistics for each fixed predictor in the model. The r2glmm package computes $R^2$ using three definitions. Below we list the methods, their interpretation, and an example of their application:

1. $R_\beta^2$, a standardized measure of multivariate association between the fixed predictors and the observed outcome. This statistic is primarily used to select fixed effects in the linear and generalized linear mixed model.

```{r}

library(lme4)
library(nlme)
library(r2glmm)
library(splines)
data(Orthodont)

# Compute mean models with the r2beta statistic 
# using the Kenward-Roger approach.

mer1 = lmer(distance ~ bs(age)*Sex + (1|Subject), data = Orthodont)
mer2 = lmer(distance ~ age + (1|Subject), data = Orthodont)

(r2.mer1 = r2beta(mer1, method = 'kr', partial = T, data = Orthodont))
(r2.mer2 = r2beta(mer2, method = 'kr', partial = T, data = Orthodont))

```

2. $R_\Sigma^2$, the proportion of generalized variance explained by the fixed predictors. This statistic is primarily used to select a covariance structure in the linear and generalized linear mixed model.

```{r}

# m1 has a compound symmetric (CS) covariance structure.

lme1 = lme(distance ~ age*Sex,  ~1|Subject, data = Orthodont)

# m2 is an order 1 autoregressive (AR1) model with
# gender-specific residual variance estimates.
lme2 = lme(distance ~ age*Sex, ~1|Subject, data=Orthodont, 
         correlation = corAR1(form=~1|Subject),
         weights = varIdent(form=~1|Sex))

# Compare the models
(r2m1 = r2beta(model=lme1,method='sgv',partial=FALSE))
(r2m2 = r2beta(model=lme2,method='sgv',partial=FALSE))

```

3. $R_{(m)}^2$, the proportion of variance explained by the fixed predictors. This statistic is a simplified version of $R_\beta^2$ that can be used as a substitute for models fitted to very large datasets.

```{r}

# Compute the R2 statistic using Nakagawa and Schielzeth's approach.
(r2nsj = r2beta(mer1, method = 'nsj', partial = TRUE))

# Check the result with MuMIn's r.squaredGLMM
r2nsj_mum = MuMIn::r.squaredGLMM(mer1)

all.equal(r2nsj[1,'Rsq'],as.numeric(r2nsj_mum[1]), tolerance = 1e-3)

```


* $R^2$ for the Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM)

The r2glmm package can compute $R_\beta^2$ for models fitted using the glmer function from the lme4 package. Note that this method is experimental in R and values of $R_\beta^2$ sometimes exceed 1. We recommend using the SAS macro available at https://github.com/bcjaeger/R2FixedEffectsGLMM/blob/master/Glimmix_R2_V3.sas. $R_\Sigma^2$ is more stable and can be computed for models fitted using either the glmer function or the glmmPQL function from the MASS package; however, minor differences in model estimation can lead to slight variation in the values of $R_\Sigma^2$.

```{r}

library(lattice)
library(MASS)
cbpp$period = as.numeric(cbpp$period)

# using glmer (based in lme4)
gm1 <- glmer(
  formula=cbind(incidence, size-incidence) ~ bs(period) + (1|herd),
  data = cbpp, family = binomial)

# using glmmPQL (based on nlme)
pql1 <- glmmPQL(
  cbind(incidence, size-incidence) ~ bs(period), 
  random = ~ 1|herd, family = binomial, data = cbpp
)

# Note minor differences in R^2_Sigma
r2beta(model = gm1, method = 'sgv', data = cbpp)
r2beta(model = pql1, method = 'sgv', data = cbpp)


```
